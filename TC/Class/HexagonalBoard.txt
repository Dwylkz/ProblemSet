PROBLEM STATEMENT
The pony Applejack has an N by N hexagonal board. The following picture shows the hexagonal board when N = 1, 2, 3, and 4.





She wants to color some cells of the board. You are given a vector <string> board. If the j-th character of the i-th element of board is 'X', she wants to color the cell (i, j). If she colors two cells that share an edge, she must use different colors for those cells. Return the minimal number of colors she needs.

Class:HexagonalBoard
Method:minColors
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:int
Method signature:int minColors(vector <string> board)


CONSTRAINTS
