PROBLEM STATEMENT
Manao has a matrix X with 10,000 rows and W columns. He likes to fill it with characters; he even has developed an algorithm for this task. First, he chooses a string S consisting of at most W lowercase letters. The string S is called the generator. Then, he applies the algorithm described by the following pseudocode:

cur := 0
for i := 0 to 9999
  for j := 0 to W - 1
    X[i][j] := S.charAt(cur)
    cur := (cur + 1) mod length(S)


Manao has recently found a matrix X in his notepad.
He wonders whether it was generated using the above algorithm.
You are given:

a vector <string> fragment that contains a rectangular submatrix of X,
the int W: the width of X,
and two ints i0 and j0: the coordinates of the upper left corner of your submatrix within X.

In other words, for all valid i, j we have fragment[i][j] = X[i + i0][j + j0].
Count how many different generators Manao could have used to create a matrix X that contains the fragment you were given.
Return this number modulo 1,000,000,009.

DEFINITION
Class:CharacterBoard2
Method:countGenerators
Parameters:vector <string>, int, int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int countGenerators(vector <string> fragment, int W, int i0, int j0)


CONSTRAINTS
-fragment will contain N elements, where N is between 1 and 10, inclusive.
-Each element of fragment will be M characters long, where M is between 1 and 10, inclusive.
-Each element of fragment will consist of lowercase letters ('a'-'z') only.
-W will be between M and 10,000, inclusive.
-i0 will be between 0 and 10,000 - N, inclusive.
-j0 will be between 0 and W - M, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"dea",
 "abc"}
7
1
1

Returns: 1

Manao has a matrix with 10000 rows and 7 columns. We know that it looks as follows:


???????
?dea???
?abc???
???????
...


The only string of length at most 7 which could generate such matrix is "abcde".

1)
{"xyxxy"}
6
1
0

Returns: 28

The given information is:

??????
xyxxy?
??????
...


The corresponding generator could be "xyx", "yxyxx", or a string of form "xyxxy?", where '?' stands for any lowercase letter.

2)
{"gogogo",
 "jijiji",
 "rarara"}
6
0
0

Returns: 0

No generator could create this matrix using the given algorithm.

3)
{"abababacac",
 "aaacacacbb",
 "ccabababab"}
882
10
62

Returns: 361706985



4)
{"asjkffqw",
 "basjkffq",
 "qbasjkff",
 "qqbasjkf"}
9031
